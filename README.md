Python script which updates a status when you listen to a song or watch a video in VLC on your local machine.

TODO
====

1. Make script avaiable for Windows and Mac. Currently the command works only for Linux. 
2. A clean title. Currently I am retrieving the filename of the media file. A clean and smart parser will be good for it.
3. Connect it to Facebook app for posting actions e.g. music play. It should post "XYZ is listening to ABC." or "XYZ in watchinh QWERTY."
